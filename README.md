# Rubber-Ducky-run-.bat
basic reference to a .bat file using a rubber ducky

To use simply replace the "test batch.bat" with the name of your file,
Note: I placed my bat file in the root of the drive, but if you wanted to keep it in a folder youll just have to make the neccessary changes to the file path
